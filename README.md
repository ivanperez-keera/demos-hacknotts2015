## LeapMotion paint program in Haskell.

Use the keys a/z/s/x/d/c/f/v to change the foreground color,
q/w/e to change the tool, r to add drops, and g/b to rotate the pictures,
h/n for psychedelic rotation, t for kaleidoscope mirroring,
i to clear the surface and p to share the picture on twitter
(needs some OAUTH and Twitter app env variables, see 
[Twitter Conduit](https://github.com/himura/twitter-conduit)
for instructions).
